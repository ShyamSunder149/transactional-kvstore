# Transactional In-Memory Key Value Store 

Here is a transactional key value store case which I'm building to learn a lot about go
Right now dumping all the code in a single file, later would do the LLD stuffs. Getting the working code ready first !!

Things planned :
- [x] Start off (having this bcoz im too bad at starting off things) 
- [ ] Initial working code

- [ ] Print keys, values and key value pairs
- [ ] Print stuffs batch by batch once the limit reaches

- [ ] implement timing based automatic transaction rollback  

- [ ] Set transaction based counting and split this separately from global count

- [ ] Refactor
- [ ] Use generics and convert it to support all types of vars
